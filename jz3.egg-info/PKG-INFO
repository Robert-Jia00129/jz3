# Argyle_Sudoku
> This project was partly based on the code from [z3-sudoku](https://github.com/awkwardbunny/z3-sudoku)

This project uses python z3-solver to benchmark encoding techniques to solving the same problem. 
It then compares the efficiency of each method and between different encoding techniques.

A demo of how to use the library is provided by solving sudoku in `./src/Sudokus`

In `Sudoku.py` both traditional implementation of adding conditional constraints using if-else
statements and our approach of adding conditional constraints using our custom solver is presented. 
An example of two different ways of querying if an index can be set to a number is presented.


## Directory Structure
- `/analysis`: Includes scripts and notebooks for analyzing solver performance and generating images for reports or presentations.




- `/problem_instances`: 
  - `/particular_hard_instances_records`: Particular hard **instances** identified during the generation process, in txt and SMT format
  - `/whole_problem_records`: **Whole** sudoku problems in txt and SMT format
  - Details of recording format explained [here](jz3/problems_instances/README.md)


- `/solvers`: Houses executables and related files for various SMT solvers used in the project.


- `/src`: Contains source code for core functionalities. 
  - `/Sudokus/Sudoku.py`: Contains all functionalities of building sudoku with various constraints, logging sudoku instances to files in string format and smt format,  `/sudoku_database`: Stores string descriptions of generated Sudoku puzzles, both full (solved) and holes (incomplete).
  - `/Sudokus/run_sudoku_experiment.py`: This file contains the main function. It takes in a sudoku file and solves it using the methods in sudoku.py. It then prints/ the solution and the time taken to solve it. 


- `sudoku_database`: Stores the already generated full and holes sudokus
  - `currline.txt`: stores the which line of the full sudokus file should the solver generating sudoku holes start loading from and solving when calling `run_experiment`


- `/tests`: scripts for development testing


- `/time_records`: Direct directory for storing time records from solver runs, highlighting the performance of different solvers.
